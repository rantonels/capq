		<h1 id="hep1---why-are-photons-massless">HEP1 - Why are photons massless?</h1>
<p>Photons, being gauge bosons of a gauge theory, are a priori massless. At least classically, a mass term for the photon in the Lagrangian:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{m^2}{8\pi} A_\mu A^\mu\]</span></p>
<p>is not invariant under the gauge transformation</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ A_\mu \rightarrow A_\mu + \partial_\mu \Lambda \]</span></p>
<p>and thus gauge invariance disallows a photon mass. The massive photon Lagrangian one would instead obtain with the above term is the Proca theory of the massive vector boson.</p>
<p>However, photons could still in principle acquire a mass through at least a couple of mechanisms. The first is also present at the classical level and is the Higgs mechanism and variants, where gauge invariance is &quot;broken&quot;, in some careful sense (gauge symmetry breaking is more involved than global symmetry breaking). Why the photon is not affected by the Higgs mechanism is treated in <a href="HEP2.html">HEP2</a>. The second happens upon quantization and is the quantum correction to the mass. Particles in general acquire quantum corrections to their physical parameters that can be investigated as being due with interaction with virtual particles as the original particle travels from point A to point B. The photon is again protected from this phenomenon and this is explained in <a href="HEP3.html">HEP3</a>.</p>
