<p>This person is particularly tricky. He hasn't attracted enough attention to be officially &quot;debunked&quot; by a decent physicist in standard tradition, but he is by all means a crackpot with crackpot proposals. He is fixated with quaternions, and believes they are the road to &quot;a new way to new physics&quot;. But besides squaring a quaternion, he is not particularly versed in the physics he'd like to overturn/contribute to. He's specialized in vagueness and violent speculation.</p>

<li>Me and him have had an &quot;interesting&quot; encounter regarding one of his articles, starts here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3b60nr/a_new_invariant_in_special_relativity_derived_by/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3b60nr/a_new_invariant_in_special_relativity_derived_by/</a> (pay attention to hidden comments).</li>
