<p>Wasted too much breath on this bullshit. The community of EM drive enthusiasts combines such a massive amount of diverse ad-hoc grotesque modifications to the methods of science that it becomes impossible to argue anything with them. Be ready to enter a world where the &quot;quantum vacuum virtual plasma&quot; (which is a nonsensical combination of words) produces a Lorentz-violating thrust which is, surprisingly, always just below measurement uncertainty.</p>
<p>EM drivers are, exactly like magnet motorists, devoted to the &quot;experimental method&quot; of rebuilding the magical device in question at home. Of course, if you repeat an experiment where nothing was observed above the noise level at home, you're going to see even less. Or more, if you can't control errors. It doesn't really matter, because independent confirmation is a boring dogma of the oppressive orthodoxy and you're supposed to trust everyone at face value, even if they're just telling you they did measure a microwave oven twitch a little.</p>
