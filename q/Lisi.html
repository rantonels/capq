		<h1 id="an-exceptionally-simple-theory-of-everything-e_8-theory-garret-lisi">An exceptionally simple theory of everything / <span class="math">\(E_8\)</span> Theory / Garret Lisi</h1>
<p>This theory is a disaster, but nevertheless it is reasonably effective at looking genuine. Lisi is somewhat familiar with particle physics but clearly does not possess the critical thinking necessary to stop himself from throwing particles in representations where they don't fit and violating the Coleman-Mandula theorem (and its SUSY extension). Lisi is behind the popsci animations of the root system of the <span class="math">\(E_8\)</span> group with particle sprayed on the vertices rotating in higher dimensions without any specific meaning to it all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lubo≈° Motl has destroyed Lisi's theory in painstaking detail here <a href="http://motls.blogspot.it/2007/11/exceptionally-simple-theory-of.html">http://motls.blogspot.it/2007/11/exceptionally-simple-theory-of.html</a>. The comment section of the article is particularly notable, first of all because Zephir's there. But mostly for this delightful, pictorial review of Garrett Lisi by commnenter Elias Newcomen:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Jacob,</p>
<p>Let me put Mr Lisi's theory into a software developer's perspective.</p>
<p>Imagine you are a top notch programmer at some company, and you were tasked to lead a project with a colleague. You both agree to split the work up and integrate it at some future point.</p>
<p>One day you get to a point in your code writing where you need to ask how your colleague approach some particular problem; you go to his office and find multitudes of little tiny stickers of different shapes and colors pasted over his computer monitor, to the point that it would be impossible to see the screen. You later find out that your colleague couldn't even start his computer.</p>
<p>I think from this point you can finish the story...</p>
