<p>The relativistic effects are very small, but not <em>that</em> small, let's compute them explicitly, it's a good exercise.</p>
<p>Basically the first thing you would think of would be to just compose the gravitational time dilation with the special-relativistic &quot;doppler&quot; time dilation; what you would get in this particular case would not be wrong, but it's not correct to assume a priori that such a thing makes sense. Therefore let's just do the whole calculation and then check that it's ok.</p>
<p>The metric for a weak static field such as that of the sun is given by <span class="math">\(g_{00} = - (1 + 2 \Phi)\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span> is the gravitational potential and all other components are equal to the flat space ones (<span class="math">\(g_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\mu\nu}\)</span> for all other indices). Placing Mercury at position (R,0,0) and velocity (meaning <span class="math">\(dx^i/dt\)</span> with t coordinate time) (0,V,0) then let's write down <span class="math">\(\frac{dx^\mu}{dt}\)</span> (which is not a vector, because t is not a scalar):</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ (1,0,V,0) \]</span></p>
<p>pretty self-explanatory. Then the four velocity <span class="math">\(u^\mu\)</span> must be proportional to this thing, but also be normalized as <span class="math">\(u^\mu u_\mu = - 1\)</span>. Then taking the square of the above &quot;vector&quot; (using the metric), we get <span class="math">\(- (1+2\Phi) + v^2\)</span>, meaning our 4-velocity is actually:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ u^\mu = (1 + 2\Phi - v^2)^{-1/2} (1,0,V,0) \]</span></p>
<p>that's very useful, because we can read the time dilation factor as the 0 component of <span class="math">\(u\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ u^0 = \frac{dt}{d\tau} = \frac{1}{\sqrt {1+2\Phi-v^2 }} \]</span></p>
<p>notice the similarity with the usual Doppler time dilation gamma factor; the only addition is the gravitational potential. Since we are talking about very small stuff, we can Taylor-expand:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \sim 1 - \Phi + \frac{V^2}{2} \rightarrow 1 + \frac{1}{c^2} (-\Phi + V^2/2) \]</span></p>
<p>Which is exactly what we would get by composing / summing gravitational and SR time dilation - so we see that this operation is only lecit in the limit of small <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span> and <span class="math">\(V\)</span>. I've reintroduced factors of <span class="math">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>One could now substitute the orbital radius and velocity of Mercury (assuming a circular orbit, which is wrong for Mercury but w/e) and get the answer but there's an important simplification: Mercury is in orbit! Therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{1}{2} m V^2 = \frac{G m M}{2R} \]</span></p>
<p>that's actually equivalent to Newton's law as you can readily check and takes the name of virial theorem. Helps a lot because our time dilation factor becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ u^0 = 1 + \frac{1}{c^2} \left( \frac{GM}{R} + \frac{V^2}{2} \right) = 1 + \frac{3}{2} \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{GM}{R} \]</span></p>
<p>So our time dilation factor ends up being</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ 1 + 5 \cdot 10^{-8} \]</span></p>
<p>meaning that over a Mercurian year of 87 days an observer on Mercury would measure around 0.3 seconds less of proper time.</p>
