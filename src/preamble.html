<p>Everyone gets bored of always answering the same questions over and over again. It's normal. Especially if it's Physics. That's why we have FAQs. But next to the <em>always</em> asked questions, there are also the <em>often</em> asked, those who just can not make it to big FAQs but really are popular enough to annoy the answerer, helplessly scrolling for new adventures in a sea of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vus.</p>

<p>This is not a definitive FAQ, nor is it necessarily a good FAQ, it's just my FAQ. It's shamelessly skewed towards my view of the physical world. It is also very inconsistent in the level requested of the reader. Typically, I'd just assume the minimal background needed for the answer to be a pleasurable conversation, neither a patronizing poem nor a bored review.</p>
