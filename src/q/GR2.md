# GR2 - In light of time dilation, can anything ever fall inside the event horizon of a black hole?

I believe the importance of time dilation in General Relativity is strongly overestimated. Many people have an idea of black holes as entities with a list of properties like this:

* uuh, gravity
* mass
* time dilation
* gravitational lensing

and then just stir and mi

So let's start from the beginning, the only thing that matters in physics: measurements. The important point is that you can only make *local* measurement, that is measurement that are close to you in space and time. So you have to imagine an observer in a certain moment of his life as a point (event) on this 4-dimensional "thing" (Lorentzian manifold) being able to look around himself in a certain very small patch around him.

Since the patch is very small, no matter what kind of weird shape spacetime is in, in this small patch it will look pretty much flat. Flat spacetime is Minkowski spacetime, the spacetime of special relativity. So there he can do the usual construction one does with clocks and rulers and build his inertial reference frame. He (let's call him Bob) can then measure events happening inside the patch and assign time and position coordinates to them. He has therefore setup his *local frame*. If there was a second observer (Charlie) **passing through Bob's patch** then Bob could measure his position as a function of time in his coordinates, and therefore measure their relative velocity. Then the change of coordinates between Bob's and Charlie's frames is simply given by a Lorentz transformation (since special relativity holds in the patch).

Bob's domain actually is a bit larger. Heidegger would argue that humans are temporal beings and span a certain finite portion of (their own proper) time from their birth to their death. They trace basically a curve, called a worldline, on spacetime, connecting the two aforementioned events. So at any moment of his life, Bob can build his local frame as before. *If* the small patches are small enough, it's possible to glue them all consistently into a set of coordinates for the small tubular region around his worldline. (Now spacetime in this tube will *not* necessarily be flat anymore and we cannot apply special relativity, because there can be significant rotation or boost between the various patches. **If** however Bob is *inertial*, that is he is in freefall and does not rotate, then it will be).

Bob's tube sounds actually absolutely claustrophobic. How is it possible that we can only take local measurements? Why do I have to wait for things to pass close to me to measure them, or say where they are at any time? Can't I just *look* at things that are away? Well, yes, you can, but what you're measuring is the *light* from those things, having travelled through (presumably curved) spacetime and reaching to you right now and right here. Light you measure carries information from your past lightcone only, and this information is indirect - it's not easily interpretable. It's not obvious how you can assign time and space coordinates to events you are aware of through incoming light. At the very least, you would need to already have a system of coordinates to map the spacetime the light has travelled through to reconstruct its whereabouts. That's pretty complex and not really relevant right now, so let's set aside the *what you see* situation.

So Bob cannot know everything. He might however be interested in *describing* everything, that is still assigning time and space coordinates to events he cannot directly measure, because it is indeed still a very useful thing. He can most definitely do that. He can take any finite, not infinitesimal, portion of spacetime, and define the spacetime grid (coordinate chart) he prefers on it. Not only: he can also make it so that these coordinates match his own local frame when they pass close to his worldline. We say that the coordinate chart extends the local frame, or better that the frame is induced by the chart. Or, more physically, that the coordinates are adapted to Bob.

Not only this is doable, it's *too easy*. There are many possible ways of doing it. And really no canonical way to go about it. So while he can build the chart, it is absolutely arbitrary (except the part close to the worldline, of course). Nothing wrong with using arbitrary coordinates, but he must remember that, a priori, all quantities he will compute will not necessarily be physical (measurable). He can use those quantities to compute observable quantities, where observable means by him or someone else. For example, he can use his extensive knowledge of general relativity to calculate what wavelength will Alice (original character, do not steal) will measure for a photon reaching her at her 30th birthday. This will not be the wavelength that you would define in Bob's coordinates, but it can be calculated from it. Since the wavelength as measured by Alice is measured right where she is at that moment, that's a genuine observable that all coordinate charts that have a description of Alice's birthday will agree on.

Bob can then be informed by Alice and he can compare his prediction to Alice's measurement. And that's all there is to physics.

**End of sermon on observables.**

Ok. So we're
