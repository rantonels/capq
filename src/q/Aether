# Aether Wave Theory / Zephir

Zephir is possibly the most beloved crackpot of the internet. He is famous for his erratic, colourful word salad style, immense persistence, and unshakable faith for the applicability of aether wave theory to every single question ever posed in history. His padronance of a huge lexicon of technical physics term, but complete ignorance on the meaning of each single word, have induced some people to believe Zephir is entirely or partly not human, but rather a Markov chain/recurrent neural network-like computer program.
