# The Stand-Up Physicists / Doug Sweetser

This person is particularly tricky. He hasn't attracted enough attention to be officially "debunked" by a decent physicist in standard tradition, but he is by all means a crackpot with crackpot proposals. He is fixated with quaternions, and believes they are the road to "a new way to new physics". But besides squaring a quaternion, he is not particularly versed in the physics he'd like to overturn/contribute to. He's specialized in vagueness and violent speculation.

* Me and him have had an "interesting" encounter regarding one of his articles, starts here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3b60nr/a_new_invariant_in_special_relativity_derived_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3b60nr/a_new_invariant_in_special_relativity_derived_by/) (pay attention to hidden comments).
