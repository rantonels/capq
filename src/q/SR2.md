# SR2 - if photons are massless, how can $E=mc^2$? 

Read [SR1](SR1.html).

The formulas in SR1 are singular if $v=c$, which is certainly the case for a photon, a quantum of light. We need to rewrite them by getting rid of the velocity. (Or take a careful limit. That's a nice alternative. But we won't do that).

In classical mechanics, this is already done when switching from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian. You want to write $E(v)$ in function of $p(v)$. So you invert $p(v)$ as $v(p)$ and then substitute $E(v(p))$. Easier done than said:

$$ p_N = mv  \Rightarrow$$
$$ v = \frac{p_N}{m} $$
$$ E_N(v) = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 \Rightarrow E_N(p) = \frac{p_N^2}{2m} $$

Which you'll recognize as a standard kinetic Hamiltonian if you're into Hamiltonian mechanics and you'll ignore this sentence if you don't.

We can do the same with the relativistic case. But first, a neat fact about $\beta$ and $\gamma$:

$$\gamma^2 - (\beta \gamma)^2 = 1$$

try it. It's very boring, but it's true. (It's cool because it implies that if $\gamma = \cosh(\eta)$, then $\sinh(\eta) = \beta \gamma$ and $\tanh(\eta)=\beta$ and if you don't think hyperbolic functions are the shit then I don't know what to tell you).

So, we write

$$ \gamma = \sqrt{1+(\beta\gamma)^2} $$
$$ E = \gamma m c^2 = \sqrt{1+(\beta\gamma)^2} m c^2 $$
$$ =  \sqrt{ (mc^2)^2 + (\beta\gamma m c^2)^2} $$
$$ = \sqrt{ (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2 } $$

So this is our $E(p)$, the so-called "full expression" for the mechanical energy of a relativistic body.

(If you Taylor-expand $E(p)$ around $p=0$, you get $E = mc^2 + \frac{p^2}{2m} + \ldots\;$. Go figure.)

Ok, so we've gotten rid of the gammas and betas. Just a last thing about them! The speed of an object is always recoverable from the energy and momentum:

$$\frac{p}{E} c^2 = \frac{\beta \gamma m c}{\gamma m c^2} c^2 = \beta c = v $$

And only now that we have built this architecture we plug in $m=0$ to find about massless particles. We get

$$ E = pc $$

and

$$ v = c, \quad \gamma = \infty$$ 

So massless particles move always at the speed of light and have energy proportional to their momentum. In the limit where the momentum goes to zero, $p\rightarrow 0$, the energy also goes to zero. Instead, for massive objects the energy tends to the rest energy $mc^2$. Therefore it makes sense to extend the definition of the rest energy $E_0 = mc^2$ to photons, with $m=0$, even if the cannot ever be brought to rest.

The energy of a photon is entirely kinetical.

Note that the previous expressions $E = \gamma(v) m c^2$ and $p = \beta(v)\gamma(v) m c$ when $m=0$ are both indeterminate forms ($0\cdot\infty$). This makes sense: we have many photons, all with $v=c$, with different momentum and energy. We shouldn't be able therefore to determine the energy/momentum exactly just from the speed, so the math honourably breaks down.
